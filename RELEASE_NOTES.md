#### 1.5.37 January 23rd 2025 ####

Moving all of our BCL dependencies to 8.0 created issues for our .NET 6-9 users when adopting Akka.NET packages that only targeted .NET Standard, so for the time being we're normalizing everything back to 6.0

* [Bump Akka.NET to 1.5.37](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/releases/tag/1.5.37)
